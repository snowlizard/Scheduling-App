## Purpose
This application allows the user to schedule and manage customer and appointment  
data. Users are able to delete, modify, and add information via the GUI. Reports
are included to track appointments and customer information.

## Additional Report
The custom report I chose was total users by country and division. Uses joins
and group aggregates to gather data using an SQL query.

## How to run
After program load enter your users credentials. Upon successful login you'll be redirected to the home menu. This menu provides easy naviation to the Appointments, Customers, and Reports menus. Click on any button to be redirect to their respective page.
